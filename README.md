## üßê About <a family Lineage Generator = "about"></a>

This is my first try at making a program with alot more moving parts, and an actual function. I will be attempting to make a website that people can come to, to generate fantasy family lineage's. These will include probabilities of different flaws or characteristics. I would like this to include increasing probability of flaws or traits if the previous generation had it. I.E. if generation 2 has "Stubborn" flaw, the probability would increase by (.10). 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a family Lineage Generator = "getting_started"></a>


### Prerequisites

Just VSCode for now, or some other IDE that has javaScript.

```
VScode, Atom, Webstorm Etc...
```

### Installing

Bro don't install this, not yet. Haha, I'll get this filled out when I understand what's happening.



## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Enter a name into the "familyLineage" variable. This will be the name obviously. Enter the chances you want flaws, which flaws, percentage of them. Repeat this for traits, then deaths. Voila. I think. Then click run, see what happens.
